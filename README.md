# Content Store

The central storage of *published* content on GOV.UK.

Content Store maps public-facing URLs to published items of content, represented
as JSON data. It will replace [content API](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_content_api)
in time.

Publishing applications add content to Content Store; public-facing
applications read content from Content Store and render them on GOV.UK.

## Content items

`ContentItem` is the base unit of content in Content Store. They have both a
private and public-facing JSON representation. More details on these
representations and the meanings of the individual fields can be found in
[doc/content_item_fields.md](doc/content_item_fields.md).

## Writing content items to Content Store

Publishing applications will "publish" content on GOV.UK by sending them to
Content Store. To add or update a piece of content in Content Store, make a PUT
request:

``` sh
curl https://content-store.production.alphagov.co.uk/content<base_path> -X PUT \
    -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
    -d '<content_item_json>'
```

where `<base_path>` is the path on GOV.UK where the content lives (for example
`/vat-rates`) and `<content_item_json>` is the JSON for the content item as
outlined in [doc/input_examples](doc/input_examples).

## Reading content from Content Store

To retrieve content from Content Store, make a GET request:

``` sh
  curl https://content-store.production.alphagov.co.uk/content<base_path>
```

Examples of the JSON representation of content items can be found in [doc/output_examples](doc/output_examples).

## Post publishing/update notifications

After a content item is added or updated, a message is published to RabbitMQ.
It will be published to the `published_documents` topic exchange with the
routing_key `"#{item.format}.#{item.update_type}"`. Interested parties can
subscribe to this exchange to perform post-publishing actions. For example, a
search indexing service would be able to add/update the search index based on
these messages. Or an email notification service would be able to send email
updates.

The message body will be the private-facing JSON representation of the content,
generated by `PrivateContentItemPresenter`, including the `update_type` field
(NOTE: subject to change).

## Dependencies

Content store relies on RabbitMQ as its messaging bus. If you are using the
development VM, it will be installed for you and the required users and topic
exchanges will be set up. If not, you need to install RabbitMQ and add them
yourself. Once RabbitMQ is installed, visit http://localhost:15672 and 1) add a
`content_store` user (under "Admin") with the password `content_store` 2) add a
`published_documents` and a `published_documents_test` topic exchange (under
"Exchanges") 3) give the `content_store` user permissions for the new exchanges.
A more detailed specification of how to configure RabbitMQ can be found in the
[puppet manifest](https://github.gds/gds/puppet/blob/master/modules/govuk/manifests/apps/content_store/rabbitmq.pp)
for content store.
