## Needed things

### Controller

* Format

### View

* API URL
* Breadcrumb section links
* Title
* Body (HTML)
* Last updated

* Related (grouped)
* Legacy sources (from tags)

## Deprecated fields to be removed

* `business_proposition` - If this is still needed it should be implemented as a tag.
* `need_extended_font` - This was for a feature that was never fully implemented.
* `alternative_title` - The only place this is used is in submitting content to rummager - it's added to `indexable_content`.
  This will be the concern of the publishing tools in future - they'll construct `indexable_content` themselves.

## Things to be provided

* Tags (TODO: Clarify what details of tags are needed)
* Related artefacts (including their tags)
